  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "CoppeliaSim"
  (requested version 4.1.0.0) with any of the following names:

  Add the installation prefix of "CoppeliaSim" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "CoppeliaSim_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "CoppeliaSim" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
